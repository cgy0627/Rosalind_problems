# Partial Permutations

[문제 링크](https://rosalind.info/problems/pper/)

### 문제 설명

<p>The statistic P(n,k) counts the total number of partial permutations of k objects that can be formed from a collection of n objects. Note that P(n,n) is just the number of permutations of n objects, which we found to be equal to n!=n(n−1)(n−2)⋯(3)(2) in “Enumerating Gene Orders”.</p>
<p>Given: Positive integers n and k such that 100≥n>0 and 10≥k>0.</p>
<p>Return: The total number of partial permutations P(n,k), modulo 1,000,000.</p>
