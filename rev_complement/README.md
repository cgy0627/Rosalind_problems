### 문제 설명

<p>In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.</p>
<p>The reverse complement of a DNA string s is the string sc formed by reversing the symbols of s, then taking the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").</p>
<p>Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.</p>
<p>Return: The reverse complement sc of s.</p>
